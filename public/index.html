      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <p>Block.co, a pioneer in Blockchain Credentialing applications, offers an open source platform to issue and verify
      digital documents in a completely decentralized way; i.e. with no dependencies to the issuing institution or
      anyone else other than Bitcoin's blockchain. This site is a front-end of the open source verification software
      that anyone can use to validate digital documents. vPDF documents are issued as PDF files with special that
      anchor them into the blockchain.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 25px;">Please note that the actual PDF document itself is not published to the
      blockchain, but rather a fingerprint of the PDF, which is enough to validate that the exact document was indeed
      published by the issuer and timestamped by Bitcoinâ€™s blockchain.</p>
